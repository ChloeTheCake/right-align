# Right Align

Just a program that takes in any text file and right aligns it by adding whitespace

F- you \*right-aligns your code*

## Why?

why not? Do you not want right-aligned code?

###### (Bonus I just added centering and next will be justified code)

## How is this even used?

There are a couple options at the moment. '--input' to specify an input file, '--output' to specify the output file name

This will definitely break any indent scoped code but y'know, is silly.

**'--preserve-indent'** which just inverts the indentation to the right side of every line

**'--align' [left/center]'** Just choose your poision ig idk
